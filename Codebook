This is a summary of the variables that result in the final output, tidyData.txt, from run.analysis.R

Variables

  features: reads 'features.txt' file
  activityLabels: reads 'activity_labels.txt' file

  subjectTrain: reads 'subject_train.txt' file
  xTrain: reads 'x_train.txt' file
  yTrain: reads 'y_train.txt' file
  trainingData: merges subjectTrain, xTrain, yTrain

  subjectTest: reads 'subject_test.txt' file
  xTest: reads 'x_test.txt' file
  yTest: reads 'y_test.txt' file
  testData: merges subjectTest, xTest, yTest

  finalData: combines training and test data

  test: create a test the results "TRUE" for ID, mean, standard deviation

  finalDataNoActivityType: creates new table without activityLabels column

  tidyData: summarizes finalDataNoActivityType and merges with ActivityLablels to include descriptive names
